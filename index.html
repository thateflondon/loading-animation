        <h1>Reimagining Our Relationship to Bees</h1>
        <p>
          “Having bees around is so healing. They are not rational. They don’t
          follow the rules, they are like love.”​ — Sam Comfort

          They’re not quite domesticated and they’re not quite feral. They’re a
          peaceful society whose labors benefit life. Little alchemists, we’ve
          been engaging with them for 3,000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          One beekeeper described encountering a swarm in the wild and being
          forever changed. Another described watching one of her bees, thirsty,
          landing on her finger for a drop of water. The bee buzzed back and
          forth in front of her, seemingly begging for a drink, until the
          beekeeper cupped her palms with more water. The bee drank her fill
          before flitting off. The mutual trust, she said, was like a communion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another describes the feeling of putting a hand into a hive as if
          putting it in a body cavity, or they might describe in detail the
          intoxicating scent of beehive pheromones at work as smelling “sexy”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The insect kingdom evolved 270 million years ago. When flowering
          plants burst onto the scene, bees evolved alongside them. Flowers
          created enticing scents for the bees; volatile molecular signatures
          borne on the air, so bees could navigate towards the flowers to spread
          their pollen, a reproduction strategy that evolved long before we came
          onto the scene.

          Awakening our senses to their lives opens up a door, like peeling off
          a veneer and seeing the biodiversity of life explode in your
          consciousness. From adaptations like chemical signatures, hexagonal
          honeycombs, and waggle dance communication, the world is alive with
          endlessly creative ways of supporting life.

          From the microbes in the soil to the pollinators of our food, our life
          made possible by a living, breathing web of connections; our plant and
          animal kin.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bees play a vital role in pollination of a large amount of our food.
          In a very real way our food chain depends on the labor of bees to
          sustain human life. We need them.
          <mark>
            We are deeply intertwined with bees in a multi species relationship
            that cannot be disentangled. They are the elder species who came
            before us, on whom we depend.</mark
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, from algae to lichen to fungi to flowering plants to
          animals to us, life is begotten in a web of relationship. From the
          microbes in the soil to the pollinators of our food, our life made
          possible by a living, breathing web of connections; our plant and
          animal kin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honeybees could serve as a conduit of entry, a point of reconnection
          into the world of other species. After all, is there any other
          creature from the insect kingdom whom we have quite as harmonious a
          relationship?
        </p>
        <p>
          Beekeepers stand in close witness to the lives of bees, and in the
          process develop an ethos of responsibility towards them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet as essential as honeybees are, the model of industrial farming is
          causing honeybee decline on a large scale. Practices of pesticide and
          monoculture use and the dominion of industry and chemical technology
          over farmland, water, soil, and air, is leading to consequences we may
          not want.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the colony collapse disorder crisis for commercial
          pollination, commercial almond crop growers are looking at
          technologically advanced ways of pollinating, including
          <a href="http://www.google.fr">robotic bees.</a> This solution, in
          which we continue on the current logical path and put all our eggs in
          the technological basket, may not solve the true problem of declining
          fertility, which may be complex beyond our control. Perhaps the
          solution we are looking for could be found, instead, in the natural
          limits of cycles that nature presents us with.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s worth asking, what does our lack of interspecies relations say
          about us as a culture?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are the inheritors of a cultural legacy of superiority over the
          “rest” of the animal kingdom. It’s us, and them. But what if what
          defines <span class="sousligner">Homo sapiens</span> is how we engage
          with the <span class="souligner">order</span>?
        </p>
        <h2>
          Instead of insisting how we are superior to bees and therefore free to
          exploit them, we could ask how humans have emerged in collaboration
          with bees: our food, our agriculture, our health.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Since bees are so entangled with our everyday lives and bodies from
          dietary consumption to the use of pollen and honey, they physically
          rupture the line between us and them. In this way, the bee can
          challenge us, in theory and practice, to reconsider the “natural”
          hierarchical order implied within notions of the animal kingdom and
          humankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Donna Harry suggests, if we examine our own genealogy and deeply
          consider how we are indeed a “tangled species” coming to being while
          inextricably linked with other species, we may figure ways out of the
          thinking that has limited our practices (Lisa Jean Moore and Mary
          Kozut,
          <span class="souligner"
            >Buzz, Urban Beekeeping and the Power of the Bee</span
          >, 2013). Instead of insisting how we are superior to bees and
          therefore free to exploit them, we could ask how humans have emerged
          in collaboration with bees: our food, our agriculture, our health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than viewing ourselves as the apex, the crown of creation, we
          could think of ourselves as the center of a web. Instead ruling with
          mastery at the top, we could envision our connectivity as a spiral, an
          evolutionary force propelling life to take form in increasingly
          complex organisms; our abilities underpinned by standing on the
          shoulders of our giants.

      <div>
        <p>
          So what might it look like to have an ethical practice towards bees?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethical engagement involves considering the bees’ health and well
          being; to engage with bees in a way in which they are not taken for
          granted as an infinite natural resource. To reorient honeybees in
          relation to humans, not as dispensable insects but as an extremely
          important species that must be protected, just as trees have begun to
          be protected from deforestation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could revere the bees’ work, we could find divinity in our
          connections to other species, and to walk on the Earth as if we are
          walking through a miracle because in a very real way, we are!
        </p>
        <p>
          Farmer poet Wendell Berry described the environmental crisis as a
          spiritual one. In his latest essay,<span
            >“The Thought of Limits in a Prodigal Age”</span
          >, he criticized our current economy as seeming to possess the goal of
          human uselessness- a race to replace humans with robots. The word
          prodigal, otherwise known as waste, or lavishness, is what Berry
          believes to be the underpinning of our current culture, and the ruin
          of it. He spoke at Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future about
          what he believes an authentic land economy would look like. “Good work
          goes beyond production,” he said. The present economy, he explained,
          is rife with incentives that favor bad work. The consequence of this
          system is that we waste fertility. The land, if treated well, will
          give us so much, but we squander it, sometimes against our better
          judgement, because the current economy favors waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, an authentic land economy would protect what is good, and
          begins with kindness. “It must involve creaturely affection and care,”
          he said. It would acknowledge our dependence on nature and our
          dependence on the natural world, and it would be built from the ground
          up, specific to the place in which it exists. A land economy would
          protect us against surplus and overproduction. The concept of
          limitlessness is a fantasy, and so is the notion that we can have
          limitless economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Berry says, “If it is unrealistic to expect a bad economy to try to
          become a good one, then we must go to work to build a good economy.”
          Since we are all implicated in the economy of destruction, only by
          revolutionizing our domestic lives can we expect a different system to
          emerge.

          Arising out of this sense of the interdependence of nature’s economy
          and human economy is the theory of <span>“Earth Jurisprudence”</span>.
          Coined by another Berry, the cultural historian, poet and theologian
          Thomas Berry, it recognizes the Earth has limits — her many gifts,
          such as water, minerals, land, biodiversity, are finite. It says that
          the universe is composed of subjects to be communed with, not objects
          to be used (Thomas Berry, The Great Work: Our Way Into the Future,
          1999).

        <h2>
          While we may have mastery, human rights do not cancel out the right of
          other beings to exist. Human systems of governance, legal, political,
          and economic, must recognize all members of the earth community as
          subjects before the law.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earth community and all the beings have fundamental rights,
          including the right to exist, to have a habitat, and to participate in
          the evolution of the community. While we may have mastery, human
          rights do not cancel out the right of other beings to exist. Human
          systems of governance, legal, political, and economic, must recognize
          all members of the earth community as subjects before the law. In this
          sense, Earth is the primary giver of law, human law is a derivative.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Noam Chomsky has said, the hope for the future lies in indigenous
          wisdom. Thomas Berry considered Earth as the primary source of law,
          and reminded us that for most of human history, cultures around the
          world have conceived law in this way. Traditional societies derived
          their ethics, customary laws and governance systems from the life
          governing laws of the Earth. This is rooted in the understanding that
          disturbing the dynamic equilibrium which sustains the conditions for
          life, would ultimately lead to chaos. Therefore we have a duty of
          care, to maintain the integrity of the whole earth community for
          future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth Jurisprudence is a philosophy, a way of seeing and relating to
          the living world out of which we have evolved, with respect and
          humility. It enables us to recognize that the dominant assumption
          underpinning the industrial growth model — that humans are superior
          and can extract from life endlessly — is both flawed and dangerous
          (Thomas Berry,
          <span>“Earth Jurisprudence Principles and Story of Origin”</span>,
          2009).
        </p>
        <p>
          “We must generalize the concept of infrastructure so that intelligent
          management of the Earth is seen as the ultimate systems problem,” said
          Professor Patrick Jaillet in his talk on “A CEE Department for MIT for
          the 21st Century.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Many projects governed by principles of Earth Jurisprudence are
          popping up around the world. One example of such a project, slowly
          incorporating earth jurisprudence into law, is the Pollinator Friendly
          Solar Act, signed by Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton. It is the first
          legislation of its kind that encourages standards for managing grasses
          and wildflowers for pollinators. Another example is The Xerces Society
          Pollinator Conservation, an organization working to conserve
          pollinators by providing education on pollinator friendly plants and
          practices. Many models of earth jurisprudence are being enacted around
          the world, as people rise to steward and protect.

          The honeybee hive, to this end, could serve as a beacon for how we can
          reorient our own domestic lives to live better in accordance with
          principles of earth jurisprudence.
        </p>
        <p>
          A honeybee hive is a unique society; it’s eusocial, which,
          evolutionary speaking, is rare. The hive mind it’s a super-organism,
          the nurses, drones, and workers give up mating to work for the good of
          the colony. Not following the generally accepted “survival of the
          fittest” evolutionary model, honey bees confound.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bee colony is considered one organism. It is said that honeybee
          colonies have reproduced when the colony has split in two and formed a
          new swarm. Bees reproduce when the colony becomes robust enough to
          split in two and swarm, creating a second colony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bees have the amazing ability to relate to one another and fly through
          space in great numbers of thousands. They collectively maneuver to the
          same place, staying in a moving, writhing, and buzzing collective.
          Once considered an oracle and prophecy, it’s awe inspiring to watch.
          Relation is the rule in swarms, rather than a centralized ruler. In
          swarms, there is no individual decision maker; instead there is a
          collectivity defined by relationally.

        <p>
          Philosopher Rudolph Steiner interpreted a thriving honeybee hive as
          permeated with life based on love (Rudolph Steiner, Bees: Lectures by
          Rudolf Steiner, translated by Thomas Braatz, 1998). Steiner thought
          that there was an unconscious wisdom in the hive that we could learn
          from. In a way, the planet and all of us on it is like a giant hive,
          all related. All, ultimately, connected as one. The bees could provide
          us with a threshold of sorts, an awakening consciousness to our deep
          lasting entanglement to the web of life.
